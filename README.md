# Imaginify

This project is based on a YouTube tutorial by JavaScript Mastery. It demonstrates a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform with AI-powered features, payment integration, and a credit system. The application includes functionalities such as AI generative fill, image restoration, object recoloring, object removal, and background removal. Users can create, edit, save, delete, and download images. It also features a login system, a home page, a profile page, a details page, and an update page.

For the frontend, I used Next.js and TypeScript, styled with TailwindCSS. The backend is powered by MongoDB, with Clerk handling authentication, Stripe for payment processing, and Cloudinary API for image transformations. The project is deployed on Vercel.
